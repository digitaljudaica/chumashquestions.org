<li>
<p>Which age bracket of Levi’im were included in the count of Gershon, Kehos, Merori? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the above three families, which was the largest? The smallest? What were their jobs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were three <strong>general categories</strong> of people who became <a href="glossary.html#tomei">tomei</a>. What were they?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From which camps were the above sent out? Until when?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a person stole, then swore falsely but later admitted his sin, how does he pay?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This subject (stealing and swearing) is repeated here for the second time. Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“And if the man has no relative,” etc. (5:8) Why must this refer to a <span class="verse">ger</span>&#8206;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="glossary.html#posuk">posuk</a> 5:9, <span class="verse">terumah</span>&#8206; is mentioned but Rashi interprets this as <strong><a href="glossary.html#bikurim">bikurim</a></strong>.
Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which important <span class="verse">din</span>&#8206; do we learn here about <a href="glossary.html#bikurim">bikurim</a>? How does that prove the rule of our sages, “the words of Torah are poor in one place and
rich in another”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of authority does the owner (Yisroel) have on his tithes that are given away?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One who withholds (doesn’t give) his tithes, what punishment does he get?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what is the reward for the one who gives his tithes generously?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman who is unfaithful is being <strong>disloyal</strong> in a double way. How?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our sages said: “A person does not sin unless he is overtaken by stupidity.” Prove it from this portion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this woman really committed adultery, why doesn’t she get her deserved punishment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the flour (for her <a href="glossary.html#korban">korban</a>) made of <strong>barley</strong> rather than wheat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prove from this parsha that it is shameful for a married woman to uncover her hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the ingredients in the water that the <a href="glossary.html#Sotah">Sotah</a> drinks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else gets punished by her drinking if she is guilty?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens to her through the drinking if she is innocent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does one become a <a href="glossary.html#Nazir">Nazir</a>? What is a Nazir barred from?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the subject of <a href="glossary.html#Nazir">Nazir</a> written next to the portion on <a href="glossary.html#Sotah">Sotah</a>? Can a woman be a Nazir?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens to the <a href="glossary.html#Nazir">Nazir</a> if he becomes <a href="glossary.html#tomei">tomei</a> accidentally?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“And he should atone on him from his <strong>sins on the <a href="glossary.html#Nefesh">Nefesh</a>,</strong>” etc. What sin? (Two opinions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="glossary.html#Nazir">Nazir</a> who concluded his period properly, what does he do at the conclusion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding the <a href="glossary.html#birkas-kohanim">Birkas Kohanim</a>, why is ‘saying to them’ emphasized (6:23)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first blessing there is a positive and a negative statement. What is their content?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is Hashem’s gift different from that of a human being?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the content of the middle blessing? The third one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which word appears in all three blessings? Are all of the blessings equal in length?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where do we say this blessing in cur prayers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When do <a href="glossary.html#Kohanim">Kohanim</a> perform this mitzvoh of blessing the Jewish people? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“And I shall bless them.” Whom? (Two meanings.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the Jewish nation compared to on the day the <a href="glossary.html#Mishkan">Mishkan</a> was erected?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“When Moshe finished putting up the <a href="glossary.html#Mishkan">Mishkan</a>.” But others also worked on it. Who were they? Why is only Moshe mentioned? What is the comparison with King
David?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who were now the heads of tribes (<a href="glossary.html#nesiyim">nesiyim</a>), what were they doing in <a href="glossary.html#Mitzrayim">Mitzrayim</a>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why were the <a href="glossary.html#nesiyim">nesiyim</a> <strong>the first ones</strong> to bring their gifts to this celebration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who got more wagons and oxen among the Levi’im? Why? Who got none? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What were the two possible orders by which the <a href="glossary.html#nesiyim">nesiyim</a> could have brought their gifts? Which one was chosen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find an example here to the saying of the Mishna, “One mitzvoh brings another one.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who paid for these gifts, the nasi or his tribe? Proof?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“He offered. . .he offered his <a href="glossary.html#korban">korban</a>,” etc. Why is ‘he offered’ repeated in connection with the tribe of Yissochor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What complaint did the tribe of Reuven have? What was ‘Moshe’s’ reply?</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Which nasi brought his <a href="glossary.html#korban">korban</a> (gift) on <a href="glossary.html#Shabbos">Shabbos</a>? (See Baal Haturim.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the weight of the utensils mentioned separately and also together?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two <a href="glossary.html#pesukim">pesukim</a> that seem to be contradictory, until a third <a href="glossary.html#posuk">posuk</a> comes and resolves it. Which are they?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In what connection is the ‘Voice’ of Sinai mentioned here?</p>
